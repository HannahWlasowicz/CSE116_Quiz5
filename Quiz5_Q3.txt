Q3 (40 points): Study the following code containing a subset of the Clicker 2 functionality.

server.py
from flask import Flask, request, send_from_directory
from flask_socketio import SocketIO

app = Flask(__name__)
socket_server = SocketIO(app)

sidToUsername = {}
clicks = {}


@socket_server.on('register')
def register(username):
   sidToUsername[request.sid] = username
   if username not in clicks:
       clicks[username] = 0
   socket_server.emit("message", str(clicks[username]), room=request.sid)
   print(username + " connected")


@socket_server.on('disconnect')
def disconnect():
   if request.sid in sidToUsername:
       username = sidToUsername[request.sid]
       del sidToUsername[request.sid]
       print(username + " disconnected")


@socket_server.on('clickGold')
def click_gold():
   username = sidToUsername[request.sid]
   clicks[username] += 1
   socket_server.emit("message", str(clicks[username]), room=request.sid)
   print(clicks)


@app.route('/')
def index():
   return send_from_directory('.', 'game.html')


@app.route('/<path:filename>')
def static_files(filename):
   return send_from_directory('.', filename)


print("Listening on port 8080")
socket_server.run(app, port=8080)

socket.on('message', function (event) {
   document.getElementById("displayGold").innerHTML = event;
});


function clickGold(){
   socket.emit("clickGold");
}

ScalaClient.scala
import io.socket.client.{IO, Socket}
import io.socket.emitter.Emitter


class HandleMessagesFromPython() extends Emitter.Listener {
 override def call(objects: Object*): Unit = {
   val gold = objects.apply(0).toString
   println("I have " + gold + " gold")
 }
}


object ScalaClient {

 def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

   val socket: Socket = IO.socket("http://localhost:8080/")
   socket.on("message", new HandleMessagesFromPython)

   socket.connect()
   socket.emit("register", "ScalaUser")

   socket.emit("clickGold")
   socket.emit("clickGold")
   socket.emit("clickGold")
   socket.emit("clickGold")
   socket.emit("clickGold")
 }

}

When this code is working properly it should have the following features:

When server.py is ran it hosts game.html/js and listens for websocket connections on port 8080
When a user sends a register message to the python server with a username it will associate this username with their socket id and setup a data structure to remember the number of clicks they’ve made
If a username registers again they continue with the same number of clicks they’ve had (The server effectively saves their game, though it does not use persistent storage so saved games are lost when the server restarts)
When a web client connects they see a page with a gold button and a display of their current gold (number of times they’ve clicked the button). As they click, the number is incremented. If they reconnect they see their total number of clicks across all connections
Each time the scala client is ran it will simulate 5 clicks of a gold button and print out the total clicks from Scala after each click

The code provided does not fully realize all of these features. There are 2 bugs in the code. Find each bug, describe which feature is broken by the bug, and explain why the feature is broken, and how you’d fix it
